# Therapy Buddy

Therapy Buddy is a SwiftUI-based iOS app exploring a personalized, reflective chat experience designed to support self-reflection and emotional processing. It is intentionally **non-clinical** and not a replacement for professional mental health care.

## Purpose

This project was inspired by the value of having a calm, non-judgmental space to organize thoughts, reflect on emotions, and practice articulating feelings before engaging in real-world conversations and experiences. The goal is to support clarity and self-reflection — not to provide therapy, diagnosis, or medical advice.

## MVP Scope
- Text-based chat interface
- Local state management using MVVM
- Supportive, reflective responses (placeholder logic)
- Clear boundaries around non-diagnostic, non-prescriptive use

## Ethical Boundaries
This app does **not**:
- Provide medical or psychological diagnoses
- Offer treatment or crisis intervention
- Replace licensed mental health professionals

Therapy Buddy is designed as a personal reflection tool and conversational sounding board.

## Tech Stack
- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Combine
- MVVM architecture

## Status
- Work in progress. Built as a learning and portfolio project with an emphasis on thoughtful AI integration and ethical design.
